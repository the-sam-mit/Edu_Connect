### Tech

EduConenct uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework 
* [npm] - npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. 
* [MongoDB] - the most popular database for modern apps, and MongoDB Atlas.
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [mongoose] - It provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. 
* [passport.js] - passport. js is a middleware used to authenticate requests in your node applications. 
* [simple-peer] - Simple one-to-one WebRTC video/voice and data channels.
* [socket.io] - It is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server.
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course EduConnect itself is open source with a public repository [EduConnect]
 on GitHub.
